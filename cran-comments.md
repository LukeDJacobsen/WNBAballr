## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have: 

Moved web reference to Description field and shortened Title.

Omitted redundant "Functions to" and added a full reb link in desired form.

Contacted Dr. Ryan Elmore and Dr. Peter DeWitt to determine proper authorship and updated DESCRIPTION accordingly. 

##Test environments
* local OS X, R 3.5.3
* win-builder

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs, WARNINGs, or NOTEs.

## devtools::build_win() results
There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs.

There was 1 NOTE:

Possibly mis-spelled words in DESCRIPTION:
  DeWitt (7:144)
  Elmore (7:127)
  WNBA (3:16, 7:21)
  
These names and a highly recognizable sports league. Writing out Women's National Basketball Association for WNBA would be awkward and less recognized.
